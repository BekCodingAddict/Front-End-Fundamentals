-------------------------------JAVASCRIPT--------------------------------------------                       
JS Data Types:
   JavaScript Types are Dynamic. This means the same variable can used to hold diffrent data types:
   let x; //Undefined
   x=5; // Number 
   x="John"; // String

JS Numbers:
  All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers(floating point);
  All JavaScript numbers are stored in a a 64-bit floating-point format.
  JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.


JS Exponential Notation:
  Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:
  let y = 123e5;    // 12300000
  let z = 123e-5;   // 0.00123

JS Arrays:
  JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
  Array items are separated by commas.
  Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.

JS Object:
  JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

JS The typeof Operator:
  You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
  The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression.

JS Undefined:
  In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.

JS Empty Values:
  An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
  An empty string has both a legal value and a type.

JS Functions:
  A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
  A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
  Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
  Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.
