# CSS 
- [ ] CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup languages like HTML and XML. CSS is responsible for the visual presentation and layout of web pages, including elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

  With CSS, you can define styles for various HTML elements, create layouts, and apply formatting rules to customize the appearance of a web page. It provides a way to separate the structure of a document from its presentation, making it easier to maintain and update the visual aspects of a website.

  CSS uses a rule-based system where you define selectors to target specific HTML elements and declare properties with corresponding values to define their styles. Selectors can target elements by their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or even their relationship to other elements in the document tree.

  CSS is supported by all modern web browsers and has become an essential technology for web development, allowing designers and developers to create visually appealing and consistent web pages.
